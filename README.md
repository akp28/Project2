Project Condor is a searchable repository of endangered animals from around the world. The site features a login system in which users, through Okta, can create profiles to access the site. The site also has autonomous user creation if user does not exist in user database. The current database utilizes data from the World Wildlife Fund.

Eventually the scope of the project will include being able to favorite endangered animals, making posts about them and getting up to date information about their population trends and external resources for donations. There will be a distinction between users and admins, with admins having the ability to regulate posts, and adding more data to the database.
